Overview:
V. Isualize has given the team a brand-new assignment. Using Python and Pandas,  create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Thenl create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

Results:
After merging the dataframes we see that Rural had the highest Average Fare per driver ($55.49) and highest fare per ride ($34.62)
The Urban drivers had the lowest average per fare.  Those drivers also earned 30% of the Rural drivers

Looking at Fare by city type we see that all 3 peak in late February . 
Rural has a slight increasing trend through the end of April.
Suburban declines after the peak in February, only to climb again  in April.

Recommendations:
1) There are significantly more urban drivers.  Pyber needs to focus on growing the driver pools in the rural and suburban markets.
2) Seeing the growth of Suburban fares in April, can Pyber transfer drivers in the short term in April?  There are declining trends in the Urban and Rural.
3) The question needs to be asked "are the averages seen in the Urban market due to a more compressed area?"  Is the inverse true in Rural market?  Can we add distance traveled in the next layer of this analysis?
